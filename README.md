# After The End
Repo for our work-in-progress survival game prototype, After the End, being built for CS 4700 - Game Development


#### Overview
- The /main branch will always contain the most up-to-date functioning release.
- The /development branch contains the latest merged changes to the game - this branch is not guaranteed to compile or run.
- Other branches for specific features may be created and deleted as time goes on. Features are merged to development when they are completed.
